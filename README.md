# Eelt's Story Tellers
Eelt's Story Tellers is a minor XML script mod that changes the frequencies of game events to create a different experience.
This storyteller is designed to:
* Promote more pawn choice
* More world interaction and encourage more caravaning
* General rate tweaks for traders, annoying events, and more.
